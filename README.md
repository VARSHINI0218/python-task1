Quiz Game Description:

Objective: The goal of this project is to develop a quiz game that challenges users' knowledge on a specific topic while providing an engaging learning experience.

Topic Selection: Users can choose a topic of interest from a predefined list or input their own topic for the quiz.

Difficulty Levels: The game offers multiple difficulty levels such as easy, medium, and hard. Each difficulty level presents questions of varying complexity to cater to users with different knowledge levels.

Question Pool: A database or collection of questions related to the chosen topic is available within the game. Questions are categorized based on difficulty levels.

Scoring Mechanism: The game keeps track of users' scores as they progress through the quiz. Points are awarded for correct answers and deducted for incorrect ones.

Feedback System: Immediate feedback is provided after each question, indicating whether the answer was correct or incorrect. Additionally, the game may provide explanations or additional information to help users understand the concepts better.

User Interaction: The game features an intuitive user interface that allows seamless navigation and interaction. Users can easily select answers, navigate through questions, and view their scores.

Randomization: Questions are randomized within each difficulty level to ensure a unique experience for each user session. This prevents users from memorizing the quiz and encourages active learning.

Timer (Optional): An optional timer feature can be included to add a sense of urgency to the quiz, challenging users to think quickly and make decisions under pressure.

High Scores: The game may include a leaderboard or high score tracking system to encourage competition among users. This motivates users to improve their performance and aim for higher scores.
